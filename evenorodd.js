// Today's question, although it might seem easy to you, is a very common variation of a question asked often during coding interviews. Please write a function to check whether a number is even or not!

function isEven(num) {
  if(num % 2 === 0) {
    return true;
  } else {
    return false;
  }
}

console.log(isEven(2))
